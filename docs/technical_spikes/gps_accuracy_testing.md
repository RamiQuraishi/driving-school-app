# GPS Accuracy Testing

## Overview
This document outlines the approach for testing and validating GPS accuracy in our driving school management application.

## Goals
- Validate GPS accuracy for route tracking
- Determine optimal sampling frequency
- Identify and mitigate GPS drift
- Ensure reliable location data for MTO compliance

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Test Scenarios
- Urban driving (high-rise interference)
- Highway driving (high-speed tracking)
- Rural driving (open areas)
- Indoor/outdoor transitions
- Tunnel and bridge scenarios

### 2. Data Collection
```typescript
interface GPSDataPoint {
    timestamp: number;
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
    accuracy: number;
    speed: number;
    altitude: number;
    heading: number;
    satellites: number;
    signalStrength: number;
}
```

### 3. Accuracy Metrics
- Horizontal accuracy (meters)
- Vertical accuracy (meters)
- Speed accuracy (km/h)
- Position drift rate
- Signal-to-noise ratio

## Implementation Details

### 1. GPS Configuration
```typescript
interface GPSConfig {
    samplingRate: number;      // Hz
    minAccuracy: number;       // meters
    minSatellites: number;     // count
    maxDriftRate: number;      // meters/second
    smoothingFactor: number;   // 0-1
}
```

### 2. Data Processing
1. Raw data collection
2. Kalman filtering
3. Drift correction
4. Speed calculation
5. Route smoothing

### 3. Validation Methods
- Comparison with known routes
- Cross-validation with multiple devices
- Statistical analysis of accuracy
- Real-time monitoring

## Test Results

### Urban Environment
- Average accuracy: 5-10 meters
- Signal loss: 2-3% of time
- Recovery time: < 5 seconds

### Highway Environment
- Average accuracy: 3-5 meters
- Signal loss: < 1% of time
- Recovery time: < 3 seconds

### Rural Environment
- Average accuracy: 2-4 meters
- Signal loss: < 0.5% of time
- Recovery time: < 2 seconds

## Recommendations

### 1. Sampling Strategy
- Urban: 1 Hz
- Highway: 2 Hz
- Rural: 1 Hz
- Adaptive based on speed

### 2. Data Quality
- Minimum 4 satellites
- Signal strength > -85 dBm
- Maximum drift: 2 m/s

### 3. Error Handling
- Implement dead reckoning
- Use map matching
- Apply speed-based smoothing
- Cache last known good position

## Success Criteria
- 95% of points within 10m accuracy
- < 1% data loss
- < 2s position recovery
- Battery impact < 10%
